Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case: Verify the behavior when valid user input is provided.
    - Input: User enters a valid input when board_type 'none' is selected.
    - Action: System takes user input and processes it.
    - Expected Output: System should successfully accept and process the user input.

2. Test Case: Verify the behavior when invalid user input is provided.
    - Input: User enters an invalid value when board_type 'none' is selected.
    - Action: System tries to process the invalid input.
    - Expected Output: System should throw an error or warning indicating that the input is invalid.

3. Test Case: Check the system behavior with an empty input.
    - Input: Leave the input box empty/blank and click on submit/next.
    - Action: System tries to proceed to the next step.
    - Expected Output: System should throw an error, reminding the user to enter a valid input.

Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case: Check the response time of the system when user gives input and it's being processed.
    - Input: Enter a valid user input when board_type 'none' is selected.
    - Action: System processes the user input and submits it.
    - Expected Output: System should respond within a sensible time period.

2. Test Case: Verify the input box design, readability, and visual aspects when board_type is 'none'.
    - Input: Visual aspects and usability of the input box when board_type 'none' is selected.
    - Action: User navigates through the input box and provides input.
    - Expected Output: The user should be able to comfortably read and enter data into the input field.

3. Test Case: Verify the system behavior under maximum load (Peak load test).
    - Input: Simulate multiple concurrent users entering data when board_type is 'none'.
    - Action: Monitor system performance under maximum load scenario.
    - Expected Output: Despite high traffic, the system should function smoothly without significant slowdown or errors. 

4. Test Case: Check the system performance under normal load (Stress test).
   - Input: Simulate normal user load entering data when board_type is 'none'.
   - Action: Monitor system performance under normal load scenario.
   - Expected Output: The system should function normally and smoothly without significant errors or slowdown.

5. Test Case: Verify the system's resilience to potential security threats while taking user input.
    - Input: Test for SQL injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other potential security threats.
    - Action: Analyze the system for any potential data leaks or vulnerabilities.
    - Expected Output: The system should not be vulnerable to any type of security threats and should maintain the integrity and security of user data.
