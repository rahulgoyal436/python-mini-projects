Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case to verify user input when board_type is 'none'
   - Input: board_type = 'none'
   - Expected Result: System prompts for user input
   - Edge Case: If the user provides invalid input, the system should present an error message and re-prompt the user for input

2. Test Case to examine system performance when board_type has a value
   - Input: board_type = 'value'
   - Expected Result: The System does not prompt for user input
   - Edge Case: If the value is non-existent or not recognized by the system, it should consider it as 'none' and prompt for user input

3. Test Case to check system behavior when no input is provided
   - Input: Without input
   - Expected Result: The system should consider board_type as 'none' and prompt for user input
   - Edge Case: If the system still doesn't receive an input, an error message should be displayed

4. Test Case to verify the user input validation
   - Input: User provides input after being prompted
   - Expected Result: The System accepts the user input and proceeds
   - Edge Case: If the user input is irrelevant or not accepted by the system, it should present an error message and re-prompt the user


Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case to check the system responsiveness
   - Input: board_type = 'none'
   - Expected Result: The system promptly asks for user input without delay

2. Test Case to examine the user experience
   - Input: board_type = 'none'
   - Expected Result: The prompt asking user input is clear, precise, and has a friendly tone

3. Test Case to verify system reliability
   - Input: board_type repeatedly set as 'none'
   - Expected Result: The system should consistently prompt for user input each time

4. Test Case to check the system's error handling capability
   - Input: Incorrect or unrecognized input given by the user
   - Expected Result: The system should handle the erroneous condition gracefully by displaying a relevant error message and re-prompting the user for the correct input.
