As an AI model, I'm unable to access the given file path to read the user story. However, I can give you an example of how to create functional and non-functional test cases for a user story. 

Let's assume a user story: "As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so I can have personalized access to the platform."

Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case: Verify the "Create Account" button on the homepage.
   - Input: Click on the "Create Account" button.
   - Expected Output: User should be redirected to the account creation page.
   - Edge Case: If the button is not working, user should be notified with an error message.

2. Test Case: Verify the input field for "Username".
   - Input: Enter a username.
   - Expected Output: The username should be accepted and displayed in the "Username" field.
   - Edge Case: If the user enters a username that's already taken, an error message should be displayed.

3. Test Case: Verify the input field for "Password".
   - Input: Enter a password.
   - Expected Output: The password should be accepted and masked in the "Password" field.
   - Edge Case: If the user enters a password that doesn't meet the platform's security requirements, an error message should be displayed.

4. Test Case: Verify the "Submit" button on the account creation form.
   - Input: Fill out the form and click on "Submit".
   - Expected Output: The account should be created and the user should be redirected to their new account page.
   - Edge Case: If any of the form fields are filled out incorrectly, the user should be notified with an error message.

Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case: Verify the response time of the "Create Account" button.
   - Input: Click on the "Create Account" button.
   - Expected Output: The account creation page should load within 2 seconds.

2. Test Case: Verify the capacity of the "Username" field.
   - Input: Enter a username with the maximum allowed number of characters.
   - Expected Output: The username should be accepted and displayed in the "Username" field.

3. Test Case: Verify the security of the "Password" field.
   - Input: Enter a password.
   - Expected Output: The entered password should be masked and stored securely.

4. Test Case: Verify the compatibility of the account creation form on different browsers.
   - Input: Open the account creation form on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - Expected Output: The form should display and function correctly on all tested browsers.
