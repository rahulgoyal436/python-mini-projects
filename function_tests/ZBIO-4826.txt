Functional Test Cases:

Test Case 1: Verify Board Type Input Functionality
- Test Step: Launch the application and navigate to the section where the board type is to be selected.
- Input: Select 'none' from the list of available board types.
- Expected Result: A text box or equivalent element appears for the user to input own board type.
- Edge case: Testing with a blank or null value, the system should prompt to enter a valid board type 

Test Case 2: Verify if the system accepts String type Input for board type when 'none' is selected
- Test Step: Once 'none' is selected, input a string value in the provided text box.
- Input: Enter a string value.
- Expected Result: System should accept the input without any error.

Test Case 3: Verify Special Characters are not allowed in the user-defined board type
- Test Step: Input special characters in the board type input field.
- Input: Enter special characters.
- Expected Result: System should not allow special characters and display an error message.

Non-Functional Test Cases:

Test Case 1: Verify Responsiveness of user input functionality when 'none' is selected
- Test Step: Select 'none' and quickly input some values and complete the operation.
- Input: Fast inputs with 'none' selected
- Expected Result: The system should keep up with the pace of the user, without any delays or lags.

Test Case 2: Verify the Maximum character limit for the board type input field
- Test Step: Try to input a larger than usual character count in the input field.
- Input: Enter a string value that exceeds the typical character limit.
- Expected Result: The system should either not allow more characters beyond a certain limit or display an error message when the limit is exceeded.

Test Case 3: Check Performance of the System While Taking User Input for 'none' selection under heavy usage 
- Test Step: Stress test the system by providing inputs for 'none' selection under simulated heavy user load. 
- Input: System is under heavy traffic
- Expected Result: Even under heavy usage/traffic, the performance of the system shouldn't degrade. It should still consistently take user input without performance loss.
