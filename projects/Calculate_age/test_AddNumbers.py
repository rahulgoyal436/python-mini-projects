================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: The function 'add_numbers' doesn't validate the types of its arguments. An attacker can abuse this by passing non-integer inputs, which could raise unexpected exceptions and could lead to denial-of-service attacks.
Solution: Validate the input types for the 'add_numbers' function. You can raise a ValueError with an appropriate message if the inputs are not integers.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Third-Party Packages (CWE-829)
Issue: The code imports 'demo' from a package named 'demo'. The security of the function or properties used from this package is unknown and could have vulnerabilities.
Solution: Review the third-party package 'demo' and ensure it follows secure coding practices and doesn't have known vulnerabilities. Alternatively, use well-audited packages instead.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_numbers_with_positive_integers
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the add_numbers function with two positive integers, for instance, 3 and 2.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the two numbers. In this case, it should be 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function successfully adds two positive integers. This is essential as integer addition forms the base of this function's requirements.

Scenario 2: Test for negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_numbers_with_negative_integers
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the add_numbers function with two negative integers, for instance, -3 and -2.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of the two numbers. In this case, it should be -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function successfully adds two negative integers. This is important as the function needs to cater to negative numbers too, thereby validating its versatility.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero values
Details:
  TestName: test_add_numbers_with_zero
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds zero to any number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the add_numbers function with one operand as zero and the other as any number, for instance, 0 and -3.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the same as the non-zero operand. In this case, it should be -3.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function successfully caters to the addition involving zero as it's a valid mathematical operation.

Scenario 4: Test for Float values
Details:
  TestName: test_add_numbers_with_floats
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds two float numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the add_numbers function with two float numbers, for instance, 1.5 and 2.5.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of these two numbers. In this case, it should be 4.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function successfully adds two float numbers. This is essential as the function is not exclusive to integers and should handle floating-point numbers successfully.

Scenario 5: Test for large integers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_numbers_with_large_integers
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds two very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Invoke the add_numbers function with two large integers.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the sum of these two numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function successfully handles and sums up very high numerical values. This is an essential aspect of testing the function's capability and robustness.
