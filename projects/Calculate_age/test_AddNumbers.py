================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsafe import - CWE-749
Issue: The script imports a module (`demo`) without any exception handling or validation. If `demo` contains malicious code or is compromised, it can lead to executing malicious operation.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Use exception handling during imports. Additionally, ensure that only secure and verified third-party packages are used.

Vulnerability: Function Injection - CWE-94
Issue: The `add_numbers` function does not validate the data types of the inputs `num1` and `num2`. If this function is exposed to a user, an attacker might input strings that are parsed and executed resulting into injection attack.
Solution: Perform input validation to ensure data types match the expected types. In this case, ensure that `num1` and `num2` are both numbers before proceeding with addition.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Add two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_positive_numbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required as there is no environmental setup required for this test.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers method by passing two positive numbers as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct summation of the two positive numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Verifying the basic addition operation with positive numbers, which is a common use case, ensures the function performs as expected.

Scenario 2: Add two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_negative_numbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers method by passing two negative numbers as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct summation of the two negative numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Verifying addition operation with negative numbers ensures the function handles negative number inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Add a positive and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_add_positive_negative_numbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds a positive and a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers method by passing a positive number and a negative number as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct summation of the positive number and the negative number.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Since our function could potentially deal with positive and negative numbers in combination, this scenario ensures the function handles such cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Add two floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test will verify that the method correctly adds two floating-point numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers method by passing two floating point numbers as arguments.
  Assert: Check if the result is the correct summation of the two floating point numbers.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Floating-point numbers are a common type of input our function can receive. Thus, ensuring proper handling of floating-point numbers verifies the function's flexibility and correctness.

Scenario 5: Add zero to a number
Details:
  TestName: test_add_zero
  Description: This test will verify that adding zero to a number doesn't change its value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers method by passing zero and any other number.
  Assert: Check if the result retains the original number's value- which verifies that adding zero doesn't change the number's value.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The test validates the arithmetic rule that adding zero to a number doesn't affect its value. Ensuring this can help confirm the correctness of the function under basic mathematical scenarios
