================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The method add_numbers might be exploited if the input isn't properly validated.
Solution: Add proper validation for the num1 and num2 inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-97: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language ('Expression/Internal Representation Injection')
Issue: The import statement from demo could potentially carry some risks if the 'demo' package contains malicious code.
Solution: Ensure you trust 'demo' package and use only trusted sources for your third-party libraries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_positive_numbers
  Description: This test will verify if the function add_numbers correctly adds positive numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: We don't require any setup for this function.
  Act: The function will be invoked with two positive numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is the sum of the two input numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to assure that the basic functionality of the operation addition of two positive numbers works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_negative_numbers
  Description: This test will verify if the function add_numbers correctly adds negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: The function will be invoked with two negative numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is the sum of the two input numbers.
Validation:
  It is crucial to assure that the function works properly with negative numbers as inputs, following the defined mathematical rules for addition.

Scenario 3: Test with Zero 
Details:
  TestName: test_add_zero
  Description: This test will verify if the function add_numbers correctly adds zero to other numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: The function will be invoked with a number and zero as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is the input number (number + 0 = number).
Validation:
  It is important to validate the scenario where the input parameter is zero, as the function should work correctly in this edge case following mathematical logic.

Scenario 4: Test with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_large_numbers
  Description: This test will verify if the function add_numbers correctly adds very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: The function will be invoked with two very large numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is the sum of the two input numbers.
Validation:
  This test is vital to demonstrate that the function can operate without error on large inputs to provide the correct output.

Scenario 5: Test with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_add_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test will verify if the function add_numbers correctly adds floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: The function will be invoked with two floating point numbers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned result is the sum of the two input numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected when receiving non-integer values as parameters.

Scenario 6: Test with Non-Numeric Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_add_non_numeric_input
  Description: This test will check if the function add_numbers handles non-numeric inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: The function will be invoked with non-numeric values as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to check that the function has robust error handling, and can manage invalid input parameters gracefully.
