Scenario 1: Validating Successful Addition of Two Positive Integers
Details:
  Test Name: test_add_numbers_positive_int_
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the add_numbers function successfully adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Trigger add_numbers function by passing the two integers.
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals the sum of those two integers.
Validation:
  The test highlights that simple addition should work with positive integers, which is crucial for verifying the function's simple arithmetic operations.

Scenario 2: Testing Functionality with Zero
Details:
  Test Name: test_add_numbers_zero_
  Description: The test is intended to verify that the function correctly processes an input of 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one integer to be zero.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers function by passing a zero and another integer.
  Assert: Confirm if the returned value equals the non-zero integer.
Validation:
  Zero is a significant number in arithmetic, and adding zero to any number should result in the original number. Thus, this test verifies the function's correct handling of zero.

Scenario 3: Validating Successful Addition of Two Negative Integers
Details:
  Test Name: test_add_numbers_negative_int_
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's ability to correctly add two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers.
  Act: Call add_numbers function by passing the two negative integers.
  Assert: Assert if the returned value equals the sum of the two negative integers.
Validation:
  Negative numbers are part of the whole numbers family, and the ability to correctly add two negative numbers is a crucial ability for this function.

Scenario 4: Adding a Positive and a Negative Number
Details:
  Test Name: test_add_numbers_positive_negative_
  Description: The goal of this test is to confirm that the function accurately adds a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one positive and one negative number.
  Act: Trigger the add_numbers function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Validate if the output equals the mathematical sum of these two numbers.
Validation:
  This scenario helps validate the function's behavior when provided with mixed numbers (negative and positive), ensuring it correctly implements the arithmetic rules for such scenarios.

Scenario 5: Verifying Successful Addition of Two Floats
Details:
  Test Name: test_add_numbers_float_
  Description: This test verifies that the function accurately adds two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two float numbers.
  Act: Invoke add_numbers function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Verify if the floating-point arithmetic is correctly implemented, and the return value equals the sum of these two floats.
Validation:
  Floating-point numbers are a significant part of numerical operations. This test verifies that the function works correctly with floating-point number inputs.
