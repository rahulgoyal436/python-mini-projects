"""
Here are the test scenarios that will help to validate the business logic of the given function:

1. Positive Scenario:
    - Test if the function correctly adds two positive numbers. For example, given inputs as (5, 3), the output should be 8.

2. Negative Scenario:
    - Test the function with two negative numbers. For instance, given inputs as (-5, -3) the result should be -8. 

3. Positive Negative Scenario:
    - Test the function with one negative and one positive number. For example, given inputs as (5, -3), the result should be 2. Similarly, for (-5, 3), the output should be -2.

4. Decimal Scenario:
    - Test the function with decimal values. For example, given input as (1.2, 2.3), the output should be 3.5.

5. Large Number Scenario:
    - Test the function for large numeric inputs to check if it can handle and return correct value.

6. Zero Scenario:
    - Test the function with one or both numbers as zero. For example, given input as (0, 3), the output should be 3. Similarly, for (5, 0), it should return 5, and for (0, 0), it should return 0.

7. Null Scenario:
    - Test its behavior with one or both null inputs. The behavior in this case may depend on how python handles addition with null.

8. Special Character Scenario:
    - Test the behavior when the inputs are special characters or strings. The behavior in this case may vary and depends on the requirement.

9. Scenario of None:
    - Test by passing None as one of the parameter. For instance, given inputs as (None, 5), the function's outcome should be validated according to how Python handles addition with None.

10. Scenario with more than two inputs:
    - Check the behavior when number of input values is more than two. This is not supposed to work, but it's always a good practice to test edge cases.

Note: Out of scope scenarios (based on the constraints provided) - 
There is no need to test different data types, as Python is dynamically typed language.
