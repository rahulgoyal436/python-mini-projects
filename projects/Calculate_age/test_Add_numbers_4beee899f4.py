"""
Test Scenario 1: Positive Numbers
- Description: Function must be able to add two positive numbers together.
- Input: Two positive numbers.
- Expected Output: The sum of the two numbers.

Test Scenario 2: Negative Numbers
- Description: Function must be able to add two negative numbers together.
- Input: Two negative numbers.
- Expected Output: The sum of the two numbers (which will be negative).

Test Scenario 3: Mix of Positive and Negative Numbers
- Description: Function must be able to add a positive number and a negative number.
- Input: One positive number, one negative number.
- Expected Output: The sum of the two numbers (which could be positive, negative or zero depending on the values provided).

Test Scenario 4: Adding Zero
- Description: Function must able to handle 0 as an input. The sum of 0 and any number is the number itself.
- Input: One number (positive, negative, or zero) and 0 as the other number.
- Expected Output: The original number before addition with zero.

Test Scenario 5: Float Numbers
- Description: Function must be able to add two floating point numbers together.
- Input: Two floating point number.
- Expected Output: The sum of the two floating point numbers.

Test Scenario 6: Large Numbers
- Description: Function should be able to handle and return the correct output for large numbers.
- Input: Two very large numbers.
- Expected Output: The sum of the two numbers.

Test Scenario 7: Null Inputs
- Description: Evaluate the function's behavior when given null inputs. 
- Input: Null inputs.
- Expected Output: Error Message. 

Test Scenario 8: Non-numeric inputs
- Description: Evaluate function's behavior when non-numeric inputs are given.
- Input: Non-numeric inputs such as strings or boolean values.
- Expected Output: Error Message.
