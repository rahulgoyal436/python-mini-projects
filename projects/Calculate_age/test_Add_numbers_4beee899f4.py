"""
1. Scenario: Addition of two Positive Numbers.
    - Given two positive numbers, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

2. Scenario: Addition of two Negative Numbers.
    - Given two negative numbers, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

3. Scenario: Addition of a Positive Number and a Negative Number.
    - Given a positive number and a negative number, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

4. Scenario: Addition of Zero and any Number.
    - Given zero and any number, when the function is called, it should return the number which is not zero.

5. Scenario: Addition of Two Zeros.
    - Given two zeros, when the function is called, it should return zero.

6. Scenario: Addition of Two Decimal Numbers.
    - Given two decimal numbers, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

7. Scenario: Addition of a Decimal Number and an Integer.
    - Given a decimal number and an integer, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

8. Scenario: Addition of Large Numbers.
    - Given two extremely large numbers, when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers without any overflow error.

9. Scenario: Addition of Small Numbers.
    - Given two extremely small numbers (close to zero), when the function is called, it should return the sum of these numbers.

10. Scenario: Providing Null as an Input.
    - Given null as a parameter, when the function is called, it should handle it properly.

Note: As the scenarios are expected not to test data types, cases involving strings, lists, etc are not included.
