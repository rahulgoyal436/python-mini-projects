"""
1. **Scenario:** Check if the function returns correct addition with positive numbers
    - **Given:** num1 and num2 are positive integers
    - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2
    - **Then:** The function should return the sum of num1 and num2

2. **Scenario:** Check if the function returns correct addition with negative numbers
   - **Given:** num1 and num2 are negative integers
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2
   - **Then:** The function should return the sum of num1 and num2

3. **Scenario:** Validate the function with zero input
   - **Given:** One of the inputs(num1 or num2) is zero
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 or num2 as zero
   - **Then:** The function should return the other input number

4. **Scenario:** Validate the function with both numbers as zeros
   - **Given:** Both num1 and num2 are zeros
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2 as zero
   - **Then:** The function should return zero

5. **Scenario:** Validate that sum of a positive and a negative number is correct
   - **Given:** One input is positive num1 and another input is negative num2
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2
   - **Then:** The function should return the sum of num1 and num2

6. **Scenario:** Validate if the function can handle decimal numbers
   - **Given:** num1 and num2 are decimal numbers 
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2
   - **Then:** The function should return the sum of num1 and num2

7. **Scenario:** Validate if the function can handle large numbers
   - **Given:** num1 and num2 are very large numbers
   - **When:** The add_numbers function is called with num1 and num2
   - **Then:** The function should return the sum of num1 and num2

Please note, as we are not considering different datatypes, exceptions due to adding incompatible types is not considered in the test scenarios.
