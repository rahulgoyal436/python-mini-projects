"""
1. Scenario: Test with a year date that is a known leap year.
   - Description: If the year input is a known leap year (such as 2000, or 2020), the function should return True. 

2. Scenario: Test with a year date that is not a leap year.
   - Description: If the year input is a known common year (such as 2014, or 2023), the function should return False.

3. Scenario: Test with the year 0.
   - Description: Leap year calculation is based on the Gregorian calendar, which does not have a year 0. The result of such input will help to understand how the function handles such edge cases.

4. Scenario: Test with a negative year.
   - Description: The function must correctly interpret BC years (negative years) as per the Gregorian calendar.

5. Scenario: Test with a year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400.
   - Description: According to the rules of the Gregorian calendar, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is divisible by 400. Therefore, years like 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600 and 2000 were because they are divisible by 400.

6. Scenario: Test with a very large year number.
   - Description: To test the efficiency and correctness of the function when handling large numbers.

7. Scenario: Test with a year that is a decimal or float.
   - Description: Since real world year cannot be a decimal, however Python language does not prevent such inputs. This would help understand the behavior in such cases.

8. Scenario: Test with a non-integer datatype.
   - Description: The result for inputs such as strings, lists etc. will help to understand how the function handles such cases.
