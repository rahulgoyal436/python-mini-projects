Test Scenario 1: Leap Year Input
In this scenario, we'd test by giving the function a known leap year. For example, we could input "2000" and expect the function to return "True", since the year 2000 is a leap year.

Test Scenario 2: Common Year Input
In this scenario, we'd test by giving the function a known common year. For example, we could input "2001" and expect the function to return "False", since the year 2001 is not a leap year.

Test Scenario 3: Year Zero Input
Here, we'd input "0" which is technically a leap year. The function should return "True" as a result.

Test Scenario 4: Negative Year Input 
In this scenario we'd examine how the function handles negative input, like "-4". Even though it's an uncommon use case, the function should return "True" because year "-4" would technically be a leap year based on the rules for calculating such.

Test Scenario 5: Non-Leap Year in Century Input
Here we'd input a year like "1900". Even though this year is divisible by 4, it's a century year and not divisible by 400, so it's not a leap year. The function should return "False". 

Again, these are just the test scenarios, not the actual test cases or test code.
