"""
Scenario 1: Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is known to be a leap year.
- Input: A year divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000, 2004, 2008).
- Expected Output: The function should return True.

Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is known to not be a leap year.
- Input: A year that is not divisible by 4 (e.g., 2001, 2005, 2009), or divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400 (e.g., 1900, 2100).
- Expected Output: The function should return False.

Scenario 3: Test with Negative Year
- Description: Test the function with negative year value to check if it can handle BC years.
- Input: A negative year (e.g., -2000, -2004).
- Expected Output: Depending on the leap year rules for BC years, the function should return True or False.

Scenario 4: Test with Zero
- Description: Test the function with zero as an input.
- Input: Zero (0).
- Expected Output: Depending on the leap year rules for year 0, the function should return True or False.

Scenario 5: Test with Large Year
- Description: Test the function with a very large year number to check how it handles large inputs.
- Input: A very large year number (e.g., 1000000).
- Expected Output: The function should return True or False, depending on whether the year is a leap year or not.

Scenario 6: Test with Float Year
- Description: Test the function with a float year number to see if it can handle non-integer years.
- Input: A float year number (e.g., 2000.5).
- Expected Output: Depending on the implementation of isleap function, the function should return True or False or raise an error.
