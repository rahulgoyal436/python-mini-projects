 '''
 1. Scenario: Input year is a leap year. 
   Test Case: Pass in an instance like 2000 which is a leap year. The expected result is True.

2. Scenario: Input year is a non-leap year. 
   Test Case: Pass in an instance like 2001 which is not a leap year. The expected result is False.

3. Scenario: Input year is a negative number. 
   Test Case: Pass in an instance like -2000. The expected behavior may vary depending on the specification of "isleap" function.

4. Scenario: Input year is zero.
   Test Case: Pass in an instance like 0. The expected behavior may vary, depending on the specification of "isleap" function, because historically there is no year 0.

5. Scenario: Input year is the current year.
   Test Case: Pass in the current year.  The expected result will depend on whether the current year is a leap year or not.

6. Scenario: Input year is a future year. 
   Test Case: Pass in a year like 2100. The expected result should be False, assuming "isleap" function follows Gregorian calendar where a year is not a leap year if it's exactly divisible by 100 but not by 400. 

7. Scenario: Input year is not an integer.
   Test Case: Pass in an instance like 2000.5 or "2000". The expected behavior depends on the specification of "isleap" function, whether it can handle non-integer and non-numerical input or not. 

8. Scenario: The function is called without passing any argument.
   Test Case: Call the function without passing any argument. The expected result should be a TypeError indicating missing required positional argument 'year'.
