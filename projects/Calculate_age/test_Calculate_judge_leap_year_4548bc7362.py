"""
1. Scenario: Year is a common year(not a leap year)
   Test: Pass a common year like 2021 to the function and expect a result of False.

2. Scenario: Year is a leap year (divisible by 4 but not by 100)
   Test: Pass a year like 2024 to the function and expect a result of True.

3. Scenario: Year is a leap year divisible by 400
   Test: Pass a year like 2400 to the function and expect a result of True.

4. Scenario: Year is a leap year divisible by 100 but not by 400
   Test: Pass a year like 2100 to the function and expect a result of False.

5. Scenario: Year is zero or negative
   Test: Pass zero or a negative year like -100 to the function and check the result. Depending on the function's intended behavior, it should either throw an error or handle the input gracefully.

6. Scenario: Year is not an integer
   Test: Pass a string "2000" or a float 2000.5 to the function. Depending on the function's intended behavior, it should either throw an error or handle the incorrect datatype gracefully.

7. Scenario: No arguments passed to the function
   Test: Call the function with no arguments and check the behavior. Depending on the function's intended behavior, it should either throw an error or handle the missing argument gracefully.

8. Scenario: Multiple arguments passed to the function
   Test: Pass multiple arguments to the function and check the behavior. Depending on the function's intended behavior, it should either throw an error, ignore the extra arguments, or handle the additional input in some other reasonable way.

9. Scenario: Large input
   Test: Pass a very large year, like 1 million, to the function and expect it to successfully return whether that year is a leap year or not. 

Remember, these scenarios depend on the actual definition and behavior of the isleap function, which hasn't been provided. Depending on how isleap is implemented, additional test scenarios may be necessary.
