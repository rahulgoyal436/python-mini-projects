Scenario 1: Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is a known leap year.
- Input: 2000
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is a known non-leap year.
- Input: 2001
- Expected Output: False

Scenario 3: Year Divisible by 100 but not by 400 Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 (should not be a leap year).
- Input: 1900
- Expected Output: False

Scenario 4: Year Divisible by 4 but not by 100 Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (should be a leap year).
- Input: 2004
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 5: Negative Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a negative year value.
- Input: -2000
- Expected Output: Error or False (depends on the implementation of the isleap function)

Scenario 6: Zero Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a zero year value.
- Input: 0
- Expected Output: Error or False (depends on the implementation of the isleap function)

Scenario 7: Future Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a future year.
- Input: 2400
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 8: Current Year Test
- Description: Test the function with the current year.
- Input: 2022 (or whatever the current year is)
- Expected Output: Depends on the current year (True if it's a leap year, False if it's not)
