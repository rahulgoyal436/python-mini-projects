"""
1. Test Scenario: Check with a year that is a common year (not a leap year)
   - Description: This scenario is designed to verify that the function accurately identifies common years.
   - Inputs: Provide a year that is definitely a common year (e.g., 2021, 1900).
   - Expected Result: The function should return False.

2. Test Scenario: Check with a year that is definitely a leap year
   - Description: This scenario is designed to verify that the function accurately identifies leap years.
   - Inputs: Provide a year that is definitely a leap year (e.g., 2020, 2000).
   - Expected Result:  The function should return True. 

3. Test Scenario: Check with a year that is near boundary conditions 
   - Description: This scenario is designed to verify that the function accurately identifies the leap year at boundary conditions. 
   - Inputs: Input years that are on the verge of a leap year (e.g., 1899 or 2001).
   - Expected Result: The function should return False for the year 1899 and also False for the year 2001 as both are common years.

4. Test Scenario: Check with zero (0) as the year
   - Description: This scenario is designed to test how the function handles zero as input.
   - Inputs: 0
   - Expected Result: The function should return True, in theory, as year 0 is technically a leap year.

5. Test Scenario: Check with negative year numbers
   - Description: This scenario is designed to test how the function handles negative values considering BC years. 
   - Inputs: A negative year value (e.g., -4, -100).
   - Expected Result: The function should theoretically return True for -4 (leap year) and False for -100 (common year), knowing that the Gregorian calendar extrapolates backward to years "BC", but it depends on the implementation of the isleap() function.

6. Test Scenario: Check with a floating point number
   - Description: This scenario is designed to check how the function handles floating point inputs.
   - Inputs: A year represented as a floating point number (e.g., 2020.5).
   - Expected Result: Depends on the implementation of isleap() function, ideally it should handle unexpected input types by raising a type error, or it could implicitly convert the number to an integer, depending on the implementation.

Note: While the scenarios here don't need specific values, actual values would be given while implementing these scenarios into test code. All the above scenarios ensure that the function is tested for a wide array of situations and not just the most common occurrences.
