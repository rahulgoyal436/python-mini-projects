Here are some test scenarios you can consider:

Scenario 1: Correctly Identify Leap Year
Given a year that is a leap year (for example, 2020, 2016, 2000), when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, then the function should return True.

Scenario 2: Correctly Identify Non-Leap Year
Given a year that is not a leap year (for example, 2019, 2018, 2100), when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, then the function should return False.

Scenario 3: Correctly Identify Leap Year even if the Year is a Negative Number
Given a negative year that is a leap year (for example, -2020, -2016, -2000), when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, then the function should return True.

Scenario 4: Correctly Identify Non-Leap Year even if the Year is a Negative Number
Given a negative year that is not a leap year (for example, -2019, -2018, -2100), when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, then the function should return False.

Scenario 5: Handling of Year Zero
Given a zero year, when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, the function should consider it a year and return whether it's a leap year or not based on the applied leap year rules.

Scenario 6: Handling of Year as Floating Point Number
Given a floating point number year, when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, the function should consider only the integral part and ignore the fractional part and return whether it's a leap year or not based on the applied leap year rules.

Scenario 7: Handling of Year has Leading or Trailing White Spaces
Given a year that has leading or trailing white spaces, when the judge_leap_year function is called with this year, the function should trim the white spaces and return whether it's a leap year or not based on the applied leap year rules.

Note: Python does handle different datatypes and in this case it would apply int() function to cast the input. The prompt specifies not to consider this aspect so these are not included. However, in a real testing scenario, it would be important to consider this also.
