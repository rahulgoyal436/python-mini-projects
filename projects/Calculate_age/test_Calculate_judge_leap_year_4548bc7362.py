"""
Scenario 1: Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is a known leap year.
- Input: 2000
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is a known non-leap year.
- Input: 2001
- Expected Output: False

Scenario 3: Year Divisible by 100 but not by 400 Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 (should not be a leap year).
- Input: 1900
- Expected Output: False

Scenario 4: Year Divisible by 4 but not by 100 Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (should be a leap year).
- Input: 2004
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 5: Year Divisible by 400 Test
- Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 400 (should be a leap year).
- Input: 1600
- Expected Output: True

Scenario 6: Test with Negative Year
- Description: Test the function with a negative year value.
- Input: -1600
- Expected Output: Depends on the isleap function's handling of negative values. If it considers it as an error, then the expected output should be an error message or exception.

Scenario 7: Test with Zero Year
- Description: Test the function with a year value of zero.
- Input: 0
- Expected Output: Depends on the isleap function's handling of zero. If it considers it as an error, then the expected output should be an error message or exception.
