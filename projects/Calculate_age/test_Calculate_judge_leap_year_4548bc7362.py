"""
1. Scenario: Test when the year is a leap year.
    - Summary: The function should return True when the input year is a leap year.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is a leap year.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return True.

2. Scenario: Test when the year is not a leap year.
    - Summary: The function should return False when the input year is not a leap year.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is not a leap year.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return False.

3. Scenario: Test when the year is a century and not a leap year.
    - Summary: The function should return False for centennial years which are not leap years like 1900, 1800 etc.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is a century and not a leap year.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return False.

4. Scenario: Test when the year is a century and is a leap year.
    - Summary: The function should return True for centennial years which are leap years like 1600, 2000 etc.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is a century and is a leap year.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return True.

5. Scenario: Test when the year is a negative number.
    - Summary: The function should return an appropriate response when the input year is a negative number, as there's no concept of a negative year.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is a negative number.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return an appropriate response.

6. Scenario: Test when the year is zero.
    - Summary: The function should return an appropriate response when the year is zero, as there's no year zero in both Gregorian and Julian calendar.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year as zero.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return an appropriate response. 

7. Scenario: Test when the year is a floating number.
    - Summary: The function should return an appropriate response when the input year is a floating number like 2020.5.
    - Initial Condition: Provide a year which is a float.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should return an appropriate response.
