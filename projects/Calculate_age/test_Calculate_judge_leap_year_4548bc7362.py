"""
Scenario 1: Input an actual leap year
- Description: We test the function with a year that we know is a leap year.
- Test Input: A valid year which we know is a leap year, e.g., 2020.
- Expected Output: The function should return True because 2020 is a leap year.

Scenario 2: Input a non-leap year
- Description: We test the function with a year that we know is NOT a leap year.
- Test Input: A valid year which we know is not a leap year, e.g., 2019.
- Expected Output: The function should return False because 2019 is not a leap year.

Scenario 3: Input a year divisible by 100 but not by 400
- Description: We test the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 (a special rule for leap years).
- Test Input: A valid year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, e.g., 1900.
- Expected Output: The function should return False because even though 1900 is divisible by 4, it is also divisible by 100 and not by 400, therefore, by definition, it is not a leap year.

Scenario 4: Input a year divisible by 400
- Description: We test the function with a year that is divisible by 400 (a special rule for leap years).
- Test Input: A valid year that is divisible by 400, e.g., 2000.
- Expected Output: The function should return True because by the special rule, all years that are divisible by 400 are leap years.

Scenario 5: Input a negative year
- Description: We test the function with a negative year
- Test Input: A negative year, e.g., -100.
- Expected Output: It depends on the function definition. The Gregorian calendar (which contains leap years) was not in use for negative years. If the isleap function handles this case, it should return either True or False. If it doesn't handle this case, the result could be undefined.

Scenario 6: Input a year of 0
- Description: We test the function with a year value of 0.
- Test Input: A year 0.
- Expected Output: As there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar (it goes from 1 BC to 1 AD), the function should return False if it follows this. However, if it doesn't, it could return True as 0 is divisible by 4. Nevertheless, the actual expected result heavily depends on the specifics of the implementation.
