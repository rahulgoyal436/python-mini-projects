"""
1. Test Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies leap year
   - Test Case: Test with the input of a known leap year, like 2000. This should return True, indicating that the year is indeed a leap year.

2. Test Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies non-leap year
   - Test Case: Test with the input of a known non-leap year, like 2001. This should return False, indicating that the year is not a leap year.

3. Test Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies non-leap year even when it is divisible by 100 but not by 400 
   - Test Case: Test with the year 1900. Although 1900 is divisible by 4 and 100, it's not a leap year according to the rule that it should be divisible by 400 too. The function should return False.

4. Test Scenario: Check if the function handles edge case years correctly
   - Test Case: Test with the year 1 (the smallest positive integer). The function should return False, as the first leap year was 4 AD.
   
5. Test Scenario: Check how the function handles future years
   - Test Case: Test with a future year, like 2100. According to the current rules, this should return False, as the year, although divisible by 4 and 100, is not divisible by 400.

6. Test Scenario: Check how the function handles negative input (year before 1 A.D.)
   - Test Case: Test with a negative year, like -4, the function should handle this appropriately, possibly returning an error or False.

7. Test Scenario: Check how the function handles zero input
   - Test Case: Test the function with an input of 0. The function should handle this appropriately, possibly returning an error or False, because there isn't a year 0 in our calendar system.
