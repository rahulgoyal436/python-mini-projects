"""
1. Scenario: Validate a leap year.
   - Given: year = 2000.
   - Then: Function should return True.

2. Scenario: Validate a common year.
   - Given: year = 2001.
   - Then: Function should return False.

3. Scenario: Validate a leap year that is exactly divisible by 4 but not by 100.
   - Given: year = 2004.
   - Then: Function should return True.

4. Scenario: Validate a year that is exactly divisible by 100 but not by 400.
   - Given: year = 1900.
   - Then: Function should return False.

5. Scenario: Validate the lowest possible year in the Gregorian calendar system.
   - Given: year = 1583.
   - Then: Function should return False.

6. Scenario: Validate a year that is exactly divisible by 400.
   - Given: year = 1600.
   - Then: Function should return True.

7. Scenario: Verify that the function correctly judges the year 0 as not a leap year.
   - Given: year = 0.
   - Then: Function should return False.

8. Scenario: Verify negative years.
   - Given: year = -2000.
   - Then: The function should return False since there were no years before 1 A.D.

9. Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies leap years in the future.
   - Given: year = 2400.
   - Then: Function should return True. 

10. Scenario: Check if the function identifies non-leap years in the future.
   - Given: year = 2401.
   - Then: Function should return False. 

Note: Some of these scenarios might change depending on the implementation of the "isleap" function and how it handles years that are less than 1 or higher than the current year.
