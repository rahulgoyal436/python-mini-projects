 '''
 1. Test the function with a year that is certainly a leap year, such as 2020. The function should return True.
2. Test the function with a year which is not a leap year, such as 2021. The function should return False.
3. Test the function with a year divisible by 4 and not by 100. The function should return True.
4. Test the function with a year divisble by 100 but not by 400. The function should return False.
5. Test the function with a year divisble by 400. The function should return True.
6. Test the function with 0 as the input year.
7. Test the function with a year such as 1896, which is a typical leap year before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar's rule about years divisible by 100.
8. Test the function with a year such as 1900, which is not a leap year due to the Gregorian calendar's rule about years divisible by 100.
9. Test the function with a negative year value. The function should consider the absolute value.
10. Test the function with input given as a string format, ie. '2022'. It should handle the string and return the correct value.
11. Test the function with a floating point year such as 2000.5. The function should return an error or handle the floating point numbers by rounding off to the nearest integer or truncating the decimal points. 
12. Check the function with an extremely large year to check how the function handles very large numbers.
13. Check the function with a non-numeric input to see if it handles errors appropriately. 
14. Check the function with no input to see if it handles errors appropriately.
