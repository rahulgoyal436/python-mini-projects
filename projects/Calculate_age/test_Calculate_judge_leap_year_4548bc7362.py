"""
1. Scenario: A leap year divisible by 4
   Desc: Test whether the function correctly identifies years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100 as leap years. For instance, 2008, 2012, and 2020 are leap years.

2. Scenario: A non-leap year divisible by 4 but also by 100 and not by 400
   Desc: Test the function to verify if it correctly identifies that years divisible by 4 and 100, and not by 400 are not leap years. For instance, 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years.

3. Scenario: A leap year divisible by 400
   Desc: Test if the function correctly identifies years divisible by 400 as leap years. For instance, 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years according to this rule.

4. Scenario: A non-leap year not divisible by 4
   Desc: Test to verify that the function identifies years not divisible by 4 as non-leap years. For instance, 2001, 2002, and 2003 are non-leap years.

5. Scenario: Border case with year 0
   Desc: Test with the input being 0. As there is no year 0 in the Gregorian and Julian calendars, the function should return False.

6. Scenario: Negative year values
   Desc: Negative year values do not exist so the function should return False when they are used as input.

7. Scenario: Testing with the extreme end of the positive integer limit
   Desc: Test with the input as the maximum positive integer possible. The function should return True or False based on whether the year adheres to the leap year rules. 

8. Scenario: Testing with non-integer numbers
   Desc: Test to verify that the function handles floating point numbers correctly, as years are always whole numbers. For instance, for an input like 2000.5, the function should return False. 

Please note that these tests are based on the assumptions that the isleap() function inside the judge_leap_year() function works properly, and the inputs are always integer values. More tests would be needed if these assumptions do not hold.
