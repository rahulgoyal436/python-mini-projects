"""
1. Scenario: Test input year is a leap year 
   Description: Check the function with a year which is a known leap year like 2000, 2004 etc. The function should return "True". 

2. Scenario: Test input year is not a leap year
   Description: Provide an input year which is a known non-leap year like 2017, 2019 etc. The function should return "False". 

3. Scenario: Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400
   Description: According to the rules of determining leap years, these years should not be leap years. A typical example that can be tested is the year 1900. The function should return "False". 

4. Scenario: Test with a year that is divisible by 400
   Description: Based on leap years' rules, these should be leap years. Test the function with a typical example like the year 2000. The function should return "True".

5. Scenario: Test with a year that is a multiple of 4
   Description: A standard rule of determining leap years is that years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. However, this does not hold if the year is a multiple of 100, but not a multiple of 400. Hence, verify this by passing a typical year that is multiple of 4 like 2004. The function should return "True". 

6. Scenario: Test with a year that is not a multiple of 4
   Description: To test the basic leap year rule that non-multiples of 4 are not leap years. Try any year that is not a multiple of 4, like 2001. The function should return "False".

7. Scenario: Test with a year in distant future 
   Description: Challenge the function with dates far in the future. For example, pass the year 3000. Although not immediately relevant, this tests the capability of the function to handle a wider range of input data.

8. Scenario: Test with a year from the far past
   Description: Challenge the function with historical, pre-Gregorian dates. For example, pass the year 1500. Although not immediately relevant, this tests the capability of the function to handle a wider range of input data.

9. Scenario: Test with non-positive (negative and zero) years
   Description: Challenge the function to handle negative years and year zero. For example, pass the years -2000 and 0. Although less relevant, this tests the capability of the function to handle edge cases.
