"""
1. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return True, as this is a leap year.

2. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return False, as this is not a leap year.

3. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is divisible by 400.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return True, as this is a leap year.

4. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is not divisible by 4.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return False, as this is not a leap year.

5. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is negative.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return False, as there are no leap years in BC.

6. **Scenario:** Test with a year that is zero.
   **Expected Result:** The function should return False, as there is no year zero in the Gregorian calendar.

7. **Scenario:** Test with a very large year.
   **Expected Result:** The function should correctly identify whether it is a leap year or not, based on the leap year rules.

8. **Scenario:** Test with the current year.
   **Expected Result:** The function should correctly identify whether it is a leap year or not, based on the leap year rules.

9. **Scenario:** Test with a year in the future.
   **Expected Result:** The function should correctly identify whether it is a leap year or not, based on the leap year rules.
