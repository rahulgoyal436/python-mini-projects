"""
Scenario 1: Check Leap Year
- Description: The function is expected to accurately determine if a given year is a leap year.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a known leap year as input.
- Expected Result: The response should be `True`.

Scenario 2: Check Non-Leap Year
- Description: The function should accurately identify a non-leap year.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a known non-leap year as input.
- Expected Result: The response should be `False`.

Scenario 3: Check Leap Year at Century Turn
- Description: The function should identify that a year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 but not 400, according to the Gregorian calendar.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a year divisible by 100 but not 400 as input.
- Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

Scenario 4: Check Leap Year at Quadracentennial 
- Description: The function should identify that a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400, according to the Gregorian calendar.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a year divisible by 400 as input.
- Expected Result: The function should return `True`.

Scenario 5: Check Year Less Than 1
- Description: The function should handle inputs of year less than 1 correctly.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a year less than 1 as input.
- Expected Result: It is dependent on implementation detail, whether it will raise an error or it may follow the Proleptic Gregorian calendar and return a valid leap year status. This needs to be defined based on the definition of the isleap function. 

Scenario 6: Check Handling of Future Years
- Description: The function should be able to determine whether future years are leap years.
- Test Steps:
    - Call the function with a future year as input.
- Expected Result: It should return whether that year will be a leap year or not.

Note: The `isleap` function's implementation is not visible, so assumptions about its behavior have to be made. This scenario assumes that this function follows the same rules as the Gregorian calendar for determining leap years. If `isleap` follows different rules, these test scenarios might need to be adjusted.
