"""
1. Scenario: Leap Year Validation

    Given a year that is divisible by 4, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return True.

2. Scenario: Non-Leap Year Validation

   Given a year that is not divisible by 4, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return False.

3. Scenario: Year Divisible by 100 but not by 400

   Given a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return False. Because although the year is divisible by 4, it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 and not by 400.

4. Scenario: Year Divisible by 100 and by 400

   Given a year that is divisible by both 100 and 400, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return True. Because the year is still considered a leap year if it divisible by 400, even if it's divisible by 100.

5. Scenario: Year less than 1 

   Given a year that is less than 1 (as there is no year 0 in the Gregorian and Julian calendars and year should be a positive integer), when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return an error message or False.

6. Scenario: Pass a Negative Integer

   Given a negative integer as year value, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return an error message or False.

7. Scenario: Year in the Future 

   Given a year that is in future, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return either True or False based on leap year algorithm. 

8. Scenario: Year as Current Year 

   Given the current year, when the judge_leap_year function is called, then it should return either True or False based on leap year algorithm.
