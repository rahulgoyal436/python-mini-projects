"""
Test Scenario 1: Leap Year 
Objective - To test if the function can correctly identify a leap year
Input - Use a year known to be a leap year. (Any year divisible by 4 but not a century unless it is divisible by 400. E.g., 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020)
Expected Output - The function should return True

Test Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year
Objective - To test if the function can correctly identify a non-leap year
Input - Use a year known to be a non-leap year. (A year that is not divisible by 4, or a century year not divisible by 400. E.g., 2018, 2019, 1700, 1800)
Expected Output - The function should return False

Test Scenario 3: Century Year 
Objective - To test if the function can correctly judge a century year
Input - Use a century year that is not a leap year. (E.g., 1700, 1800, 1900)
Expected Output - The function should return False

Test Scenario 4: Century Leap Year 
Objective - To test if the function can correctly judge a century leap year
Input - Use a century year that is a leap year. (Any century year that is divisible by 400. E.g., 1600, 2000, 2400)
Expected Output - The function should return True

Test Scenario 5: Zero Year 
Objective - To test what the function returns for year zero
Input - Use 0 as the year
Expected Output - The function should return a suitable value per the implementation details

Test Scenario 6: Negative Year 
Objective - To test what the function returns for negative year
Input - Use a negative number as the year 
Expected Output - The function should return a suitable value per the implementation details
