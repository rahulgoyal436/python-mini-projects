"""
1. Test scenario: Verify with a known leap year.
   Test case: Provide a year that we already know to be a leap year, like 2020, and check if the function returns True.

2. Test scenario: Verify with a known non-leap year.
   Test case: Provide a year that we already know is not a leap year e.g., 2019 and check if the function returns False.

3. Test scenario: Verify with a leap year from the distant past.
   Test case: Input a year from the distant past that is a leap year e.g., 1600, and check if the function returns True.

4. Test scenario: Verify with a non-leap year from the distant past.
   Test case: Input a non-leap year from the distant past, like 1901, and validate if the function returns False.

5. Test scenario: Verify with a leap year from the far future.
   Test case: Input a year from the far future that is a leap year, like 3000, and check if the function returns True.

6. Test scenario: Verify with a non-leap year from the far future.
   Test case: Input a non-leap year from the far future, like 3001, and validate if the function returns False.

7. Test scenario: Verify with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
   Test case: Input a year like 1900, which despite being divisible by 4 is not a leap year, as it is divisible by 100 but not by 400. The function should return False.

8. Test scenario: Verify with a year that is divisible by 400.
   Test case: Input a year like 2000, which is a leap year because it is divisible by 400. The function should output True.

9. Test scenario: Verify with a negative year.
   Test case: Input a negative year like -1600 and validate if the function returns an appropriate response as per system design or if it handles such cases. 

10. Test scenario: Verify with year 0
    Test case: Input year 0 and check the function's output. The Gregorian calendar does not include a year 0, so it should be handled appropriately by the system.
