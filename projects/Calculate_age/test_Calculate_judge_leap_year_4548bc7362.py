"""
1. Scenario: Test with a leap year 
    - Description: Test the function with a leap year to check if it correctly identifies it. 
    - Input: 2000
    - Expected output: True 

2. Scenario: Test with a typical non-leap year
    - Description: Test the function with a standard non-leap year to verify it correctly identifies it.
    - Input: 2001
    - Expected output: False 

3. Scenario: Test with a year divisible by 100 but not by 400
    - Description: Leap years should be divisible by 4, but years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. This test scenario will verify this part of the leap year rule.
    - Input: 1900
    - Expected Output: False

4. Scenario: Test with a negative year 
    - Description: Leap years are defined for AD, so testing with a year before 1 AD can help verify how the function handles such scenarios. However, this would rely on how the isleap function handles such scenarios.
    - Input: -2000
    - Expected output: Depends on how isleap function is defined for BC years. 

5. Scenario: Test with a year that's a multiple of 400
    - Description: Years divisible by 400 are leap years. This test scenario verifies this rule.
    - Input: 1600
    - Expected output: True

6. Scenario: Test with a small non-leap year
    - Description: Testing with a small non-leap year will help to test if the function handles small inputs.
    - Input:  7
    - Expected Output: False

7. Scenario: Test with a small leap year 
    - Description: Testing with a small leap year will help to test if the function handles small leap year inputs.
    - Input:  8
    - Expected Output: True

8. Scenario: Test with year as Zero
    - Description: Year 0 is undefined, this test will check how isleap function behaves for the year Zero.
    - Input: 0
    - Expected Output: Depends on how isleap function is defined for Zero year.
