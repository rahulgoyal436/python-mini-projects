 '''
 1. Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies a leap year.
    Input: 2020
    Expected Output: True
    Description: The year 2020 is a leap year because it's divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400 which makes it a leap year, so the function should return True.

2. Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies a non-leap year.
    Input: 2019
    Expected Output: False
    Description: The year 2019 is not a leap year because it's not divisible by 4, so the function should return False.

3. Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies a year divisible by 100 but not by 400 as a non-leap year.
    Input: 2100
    Expected Output: False
    Description: The year 2100 is divisible by 100 but not by 400, so it's not a leap year. The function should therefore return False.
    
4. Scenario: Check if the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 400 as a leap year.
    Input: 2000
    Expected Output: True
    Description: The year 2000 is divisible by 400, so it's a leap year. The function should return True.
    
5. Scenario: Check for the earliest valid year input (Gregorian calendar â€“ since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, which is used today).
    Input: 1582
    Expected Output: False
    Description: The year 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was adopted, is not a leap year. The function should return False.
   
6. Scenario: Check for invalid input, like zero.
    Input: 0
    Expected Output: Could be True or False, depending on the definition of what a leap year is. This is not clearly specified, so can't be definitively determined here.
    Description: Zero is not a year and should either result in an error or be defined through specifications.

7. Scenario: Check for negative numbers.
    Input: -1700 
    Expected Output: Could be True or False, depending whether B.C.E. years are included. This is not clearly specified, so can't be definitively determined here. 
    Description: Negative numbers could represent years B.C.E.; if the Gregorian calendar is extended into B.C.E., leap years can be calculated similarly. 

8. Scenario: Check for non-integer input types (Example: string, float).
    Input: '2004', 2004.5 
    Expected Output: An error should be thrown.
    Description: The function should only accept integer inputs, and throw an error for other types.
