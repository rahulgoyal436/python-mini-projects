"""
Scenario 1: Input is a Leap Year
In this scenario, the input year is a leap year. A leap year is a year that is exactly divisible by 4 except for end of century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, years like 2008, 2012, 2016 should return True.

Scenario 2: Input is not a Leap Year
For this scenario, the input year is not a leap year. Years like 2001, 2005, 2009 should return False.

Scenario 3: Input is a Century year that is not a Leap Year
In this scenario, the input year is a century year that is not divisible by 400, and hence, is not a leap year. For instance, year 1900 or 2100 should return False.

Scenario 4: Input is a Century year that is a Leap Year
For this scenario, the input is a century year that is divisible by 400, hence is a leap year. E.g. years 2000 and 2400 should return True.

Scenario 5: Negative Input
Though not common, a scenario could be where the year input is negative. Negative years are usually used to represent years before AD (or 'Before Common Era'), so the function should still behave correctly. For example, -1600 (or 1600 BC/BCE) should return True as it is a leap year.

Scenario 6: Input is Zero
Zero isnâ€™t a year in the Gregorian calendar, however the function should still encounter an appropriate behavior, in which case, a decision on the expected outcome should be reached. 

Scenario 7: Input is a Non-integer type
Even though python supports dynamic typing the function may still fail (or behave unexpectedly) if the year input is not an integer. Inputs such as float types (e.g., 2000.0), string types (e.g., "2000"), or boolean types (e.g., True, False) should also be considered. Expected outcome for this condition should be determined.
