Scenario 1: Normal Case
Given the year "2000" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "True".

Scenario 2: Normal Case 
Given the year "2021" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "False". 

Scenario 3: Boundary Case
Given the year "1" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "False".

Scenario 4: Normal Case
Given the year "2400" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "True".

Scenario 5: Normal Case
Given the year "1900" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "False".

Scenario 6: Boundary Case
Given the year "0" when verify if it is leap year, the function should return "False". 

Note: Here, 0 and 1 are used as lower boundary case considering AD starts. If BC years are included, then negative years would be used as smaller boundary test case. Also, usually 4-digit years are normal case to test this function.
