"""
1. Scenario: Test when the input year is a leap year. 
   - Description: Pass in a year that is a leap year(e.g., 2000)
   - Expected Result: The function should return True.

2. Scenario: Test when the input year is not a leap year. 
   - Description: Pass in a year that is not a leap year(e.g., 2001)
   - Expected Result: The function should return False.

3. Scenario: Test when the input year is a century year which is not a leap year.
   - Description: Pass in a century year which is not a leap year (e.g., 1900)
   - Expected Result: The function should return False.

4. Scenario: Test when the input year is a century year which is a leap year.
   - Description: Pass in a century year which is a leap year (e.g., 1600)
   - Expected Result: The function should return True.

5. Scenario: Test when the input year is Zero.
   - Description: Pass in the year as zero (0)
   - Expected Result: The function should return False as there was no year zero in our calendar.

6. Scenario: Test when the input year is a negative number.
   - Description: Pass in the year as a negative number (e.g., -2000)
   - Expected Result: The function should return False as there are no negative years in our calendar.

7. Scenario: Test when the input year is a future leap year.
   - Description: Pass in a year that is a future leap year (e.g., 2104)
   - Expected Result: The function should return True.

8. Scenario: Test when the input year is a future non-leap year.
   - Description: Pass in a future year that is not a leap year (e.g., 2101)
   - Expected Result: The function should return False.

9. Scenario: Test with the current year.
   - Description: Pass in the current year (e.g., TIMESTAMP(year))
   - Expected Result: The function should return either True or False depending on whether the current year is a leap year or not.

10. Scenario: Test with minimum valid year that can be provided (e.g., Year 1)
    - Description: Pass in the year one (1), considering the Gregorian Calendar started from this year.
    - Expected Result: The function should return False considering year one is not a leap year.
