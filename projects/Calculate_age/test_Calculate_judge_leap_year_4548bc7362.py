"""
1. Scenario: Judging an obvious leap year

   Description: Ensure that if a year is obviously a leap year, the function should return True. E.g., 2000, 2004.

2. Scenario: Judging a non-leap year

   Description: Test that if a year is obviously not a leap year, the function should return False. E.g., 2001, 2100.

3. Scenario: Judging leap year near transition point

   Description: Ensure that if a year lies close to the transition between a leap year and a non-leap year, the function should be able to correctly judge whether it is a leap year. (E.g., for years around 1999-2001).

4. Scenario: Judging leap year at edge case year zero

   Description: Check if the function correctly returns True for year 0, often considered a leap year in many calendars (eating into Judaeo-Christian religious arguments).

5. Scenario: Judging leap year with negative year

   Description: Test that the function can handle negative years, and correctly judges them as leap years if they follow the rule.

6. Scenario: Judging a year far in the future

   Description: The function should still accurately judge years that are far in the future.

7. Scenario: Judging a year far in the past

   Description: The function should also accurately judge years that are far in the past.

8. Scenario: Judging a year with zero

   Description: Ensure that the function accurately returns False for a year of zero.

9. Scenario: Judging a leap year when the year is not an integer

   Description: Test that the function behaves properly when given a year that is not an integer.
