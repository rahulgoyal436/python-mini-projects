"""
Test Scenario 1:
Title: Validate whether the function can identify leap years.
Description: Pass a year that you know is a leap year to the function and verify if it correctly identifies as True.

Test Scenario 2:
Title: Validate whether the function can identify non-leap years.
Description: Pass a year that you know is not a leap year to the function and verify if it correctly identifies as False.

Test Scenario 3:
Title: Test with the year 0 (Zero)
Description: Check how the function handles the year 0. Depending upon the adopted calendar, year 0 could be a leap year.

Test Scenario 4:
Title: Test with a negative year.
Description: Check how the function handles negative numbers. Some calendar systems do count backward for years before a certain point.

Test Scenario 5:
Title: Test with a very large number.
Description: We would like to see if the size of the input affects the function output. Check if a very large year value impacts the function's ability to accurately determine leap years.

Test Scenario 6:
Title: Test with the minimum positive valid integer.
Description: Pass 1 to the function to see if it correctly identifies a non-leap year.

Test Scenario 7:
Title: Validate the function with the year of a century.
Description: Pass a year that is the year of a century and verify if it correctly identifies as False. Most century years are non-leap except those perfectly divisible by 400.

Test Scenario 8:
Title: Validate the function with the year of a century that is a leap year.
Description: Pass a year that is the year of a century and verify if it correctly identifies as True. If the century year is perfectly divisible by 400, it's a leap year. 

Test Scenario 9:
Title: Validate with decimal numbers
Description: Check how the function handles decimal numbers. While technically invalid as you can't have a fraction of a year, but interesting to see how system handles such inputs.
