"""
Scenario 1: Leap Year Check
When given year is a known leap year (e.g., 2020, 2000), expect the function to return True as those years are leap years.

Scenario 2: Non-Leap Year Check
When given year is a known non-leap year (e.g., 2019, 2100), expect the function to return False as those years are non-leap years.

Scenario 3: Year Before Gregorian Calendar
When given a year before the Gregorian Calendar was established (e.g., 1581), the result might vary as the Gregorian Calendar started from 1582. It's hard to determine whether these years were leap years or not.

Scenario 4: Future Leap Year Check
When given a year that is a future leap year (e.g., 2024), expect the function to return True as it's a leap year according to the rules.

Scenario 5: Future Non-Leap Year Check
When given a year that is a future non-leap year (e.g., 2023), expect the function to return False as it's not a leap year according to the rules.

Scenario 6: Beginning of century (Non-leap year) check
When given a year that is at the beginning of a century which is not divisible evenly by 400 (e.g., 2100), the result should be False, as even those years are not leap years despite being divisible by 4.

Scenario 7: Beginning of century (Leap year) check
When given a year that is at the beginning of a century which is divisible evenly by 400 (e.g., 2000), the result should be True, as according to the rules these years are considered leap years. 

Scenario 8: Zero Year Check
When given a year that is zero (0), the result might vary as there is no year 0 in the anno Domini system. Therefore, the function should return False.
