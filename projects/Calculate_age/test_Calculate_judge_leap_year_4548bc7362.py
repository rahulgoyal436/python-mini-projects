"""
1. Test Scenario: Inputting leap year
   Given a year which is a leap year (like 2000, 2004, etc) as input, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should return `True`. 

2. Test Scenario: Inputting non-leap year
   Given a year which is not a leap year (like 2001, 2003, etc) as input, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should return `False`.

3. Test Scenario: Inputting the year 0
   Given the year 0 as input, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should return `True` as 0 is a leap year. 

4. Test Scenario: Inputting negative integers
   Given a negative integer as input (like -2000, -4, etc), when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then it's unclear what the return value should be as the concept of a leap year technically doesn't exist for BCE years. You should clarify with your team how this case should be handled.

5. Test Scenario: Inputting a large year value
   Given a large year value (like 2000000) as input, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should still correctly identify whether the year is a leap year or not, demonstrating its ability to handle large inputs.

6. Test Scenario: Inputting a non-integer value
   Given a non-integer value as input (like '2004', 2000.4), when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then it depends on whether `isleap` function can handle these situations. The expected result is not clear without further information.

7. Test Scenario: Inputting the boundary value 1896
   Given the year 1896 as input, which is the earliest year within the Gregorian calendar that we can definitively call a leap year, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should return `True`.

8. Test Scenario: Inputting no value
   Given no value as input, when the function `judge_leap_year` is called, then the function should raise a `TypeError` as it expects one argument.
