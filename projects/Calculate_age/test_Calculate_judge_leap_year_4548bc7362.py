"""
1. **Scenario**: Test with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100
   **Expected Result**: The function should return True, as this is the definition of a leap year.

2. **Scenario**: Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400
   **Expected Result**: The function should return False, as this is not considered a leap year.

3. **Scenario**: Test with a year that is divisible by both 100 and 400
   **Expected Result**: The function should return True, as this is considered a leap year.

4. **Scenario**: Test with a year that is not divisible by 4
   **Expected Result**: The function should return False, as this is not a leap year.

5. **Scenario**: Test with a negative year
   **Expected Result**: Depending on the business logic's handling of BC years, this may return an error, or it may return False (as there were no leap years before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar).

6. **Scenario**: Test with a non-integer year (e.g. a float or a string)
   **Expected Result**: This should return an error, as the year should be an integer. 

7. **Scenario**: Test with a future year that is a leap year
   **Expected Result**: The function should return True. 

8. **Scenario**: Test with a future year that is not a leap year
   **Expected Result**: The function should return False.

9. **Scenario**: Test with the current year
   **Expected Result**: The function should return True if the current year is a leap year, False otherwise.
