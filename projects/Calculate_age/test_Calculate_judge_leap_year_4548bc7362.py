 '''
 1. Test with a year that is a known leap year (e.g., 2000, 2004, 2008, etc.). The function should return True.
2. Test with a year that is known not to be a leap year (e.g., 2001, 2002, 2003, etc.). The function should return False.
3. Test with a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016, etc.). These are leap years, so the function should return True.
4. Test with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 (e.g., 2100, 2200, 2300). Despite being divisible by 4, these are not leap years so the function should return False.
5. Test with a year that is divisible by 400 (e.g., 1600, 2000, 2400). These are leap years, so the function should return True.
6. Test with the current year. Verify if the function correctly identifies if it is a leap year or not based on the standard rules.
7. Test with a year less than 1 (negative numbers, 0). The function's behavior is undefined for these inputs.
8. Test with a year that is a floating point value (e.g., 2000.5, 2012.33). The function's behavior is undefined for these inputs.
9. Test with a non-integer or non-numeric input (e.g., 'banana', '2000'). The function's behavior is undefined for these inputs.
10. Test with the smallest and largest practical values allowed by the system for the 'year' variable. The function's behavior may vary depending on how it handles overflow and underflow.
