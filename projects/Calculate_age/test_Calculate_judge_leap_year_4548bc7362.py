"""
1. Scenario: Test with a year that is not a leap year.
   - Given the year is 1900.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `False`.

2. Scenario: Test with a year that is a leap year.
   - Given the year is 2000.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True`.

3. Scenario: Test with a year that is not a leap year, yet divisible by 4.
   - Given the year is 2100.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `False`.

4. Scenario: Test with a year that is a leap year and divisible by 400.
   - Given the year is 2400.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True`.

5. Scenario: Test with a year that is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100.
   - Given the year is 2024.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True`.

6. Scenario: Test with a valid year input that is not a leap year.
   - Given the year is 3001.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `False`.

7. Scenario: Test with a non-leap year in distant past.
   - Given the year is 1801.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `False`.

8. Scenario: Test with a leap year in distant past.
   - Given the year is 1600.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True`.

9. Scenario: Test with a year that is the current year.
   - Given the year is current year.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True` if it's a leap year, or `False` otherwise.

10. Scenario: Test with a future year that is expected to be a leap year.
   - Given the year is 2044.
   - The function `judge_leap_year` should return `True`.
