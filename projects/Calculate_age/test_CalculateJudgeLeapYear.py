``` 
Scenario 1: Valid Leap Year
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly identifies a valid leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is needed as the function only requires a simple integer as an argument.
  Act: We'll pass a year that is known to be a leap year to the function, such as 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True, as 2000 is a leap year.
Validation:
  The logic for determining a leap year is well-established, so if the function successfully identifies a known leap year, it likely works correctly. Thus, the expected result is True.

Scenario 2: Invalid Leap Year
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly identifies a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup would be similar to that of the previous scenario - no special setup is needed.
  Act: We'll pass a year that is known to not be a leap year to the function, like 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False, since 1900 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This test is as important as the valid leap year test, as the function must be able to correctly identify both scenarios. Thus, the expected result is False.

Scenario 3: Edge Case - Earliest Leap Year
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly identifies the earliest scientifically accepted leap year, 1752.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup—same as before.
  Act: We'll pass year 1752 into the function, which is the first leap year in many timelines.
  Assert: The function should return True, since 1752 is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing the edge conditions (like the earliest possible leap year) is important to ensure the function works in all situations, and not just in normal or ideal conditions. Hence, the expected result is True.

Scenario 4: Test a Future Valid Leap Year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_valid_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly identifies a valid leap year in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup—maintaining the same setup as before.
  Act: We'll pass a future year like 2400 - a future leap year to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True, since 2400 will be a leap year.
Validation:
  This test is important to establish that the function will continue to be relevant in the future. Thus, the expected result is True.
