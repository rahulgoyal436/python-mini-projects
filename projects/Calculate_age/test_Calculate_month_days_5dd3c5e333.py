# Test generated by RoostGPT for test roost-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

"""
1. Scenario: Test with a month that should return 31 days.
   Input: (7, True)
   Expected Output: 31
   
2. Scenario: Test with a month that should return 30 days.
   Input: (6, False)
   Expected Output: 30
   
3. Scenario: Test with the month of February in a leap year.
   Input: (2, True)
   Expected Output: 29

4. Scenario: Test with the month of February in a non-leap year.
   Input: (2, False)
   Expected Output: 28

5. Scenario: Test with a month number that is less than 1.
   Input: (-1, False)
   Expected Output: This might throw an error or return `None` based on the overall program structure. So validate this accordingly.

6. Scenario: Test with a month number that is greater than 12.
   Input: (13, True)
   Expected Output: This might error out or return `None` based on how the function is supposed to behave in the overall program.

7. Scenario: Test with leap year value as not a boolean.
   Input: (2, 'True')
   Expected Output: This might error out or return `None`. As the function seems to expect a boolean, giving it a string (even if it's 'True' or 'False') might cause it to behave unexpectedly.

8. Scenario: Test with no parameters passed to the function.
   Input: ()
   Expected Output: This might error out, as both parameters are required, or it might return `None`.

9. Scenario: Test with additional unexpected parameters.
   Input: (1, True, "extra")
   Expected Output: This might error out because the function doesn't know what to do with extra arguments, or it might ignore the extra argument and give a valid result.

10. Scenario: Test with month as a decimal.
    Input: (2.5, False)
    Expected Output: This might error out because the function likely expects integers for the month.
