"""
1. Scenario: Correct number of days for the months having 31 days

   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] one at a time and "leap_year" as False. Expected output is 31 for all these months.

2. Scenario: Correct number of days for the months having 30 days
   
   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as [4, 6, 9, 11] one at a time and "leap_year" as False. Expected output is 30 for all these months.

3. Scenario: Correct number of days for February in a non-leap year
   
   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as 2 and "leap_year" as False. Expected output is 28.

4. Scenario: Correct number of days for February in a leap year

   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as 2 and "leap_year" as True. Expected output is 29.

5. Scenario: Months outside the range of 1-12
   
   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as any number not in the range of 1 to 12, and "leap_year" as either True or False. Expected result is an error or undefined behavior, depending on how the function is expected to handle invalid input.

6. Scenario: Leap year value is neither True nor False

   Test Case: Provide arguments "month" as any number in the range of 1 to 12, and "leap_year" is not a boolean value. Expected result should return the appropriate days for months other than February but an error or undefined behavior for February.

7. Scenario: Test with missing parameters

   Test Case: Call the function with missing parameters. The expected output should be an error since both parameters are required. 

8. Scenario: Pass month as string rather than integer

   Test Case: Pass months as a string not an integer and "leap_year" false. Expected result is an error or undefined behavior, depending on how the function is expected to handle invalid input.
