"""
1. Scenario: Testing if method returns correct days for January
   - Inputs: month = 1 (January), leap_year = False/True
   - Expected result: As January is the first month and it always has 31 days, regardless of what year it is, the expected return should be 31.

2. Scenario: Testing if method returns correct days for February in a leap year
   - Inputs: month = 2 (February), leap_year = True
   - Expected result: As February in a leap year has 29 days, the expected return should be 29.

3. Scenario: Testing if method returns correct days for February in a non-leap year
   - Inputs: month = 2 (February), leap_year = False
   - Expected result: As February in a non-leap year has 28 days, the expected return should be 28.

4. Scenario: Testing if method returns correct days for a month with 30 days (e.g. April)
   - Inputs: month = 4 (April), leap_year = False/True
   - Expected result: As April has 30 days, regardless of the year type, the expected return should be 30.

5. Scenario: Testing if method returns correct days for a month with 31 days (e.g. May)
   - Inputs: month = 5 (May), leap_year = False/True
   - Expected result: As May has 31 days, regardless of the year type, the expected return should be 31.

6. Scenario: Testing if method handles a month that doesn't exist (e.g. 13)
   - Inputs: month = 13, leap_year = True/False
   - Expected result: As month 13 does not exist, the method should return None or an error message, depending on how the function is designed to handle such situations.

7. Scenario: Testing if method handles a negative month (e.g. -1)
   - Inputs: month = -1, leap_year = True/False
   - Expected result: As there is no negative month, the method should return None or an error message, depending on how the function handles unexpected inputs.
