"""
1. Scenario 1: Input one of the months from [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year status. The function should return 31, suggesting these months have 31 days.

2. Scenario 2: Input one of the months from [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year status. The function should return 30, confirming these months have 30 days.

3. Scenario 3: Input month as 2 (February) and leap_year as True. The function should return 29, as February has 29 days in a leap year.

4. Scenario 4: Input month as 2 (February) and leap_year as False. The function should return 28, as February has 28 days in non-leap years.

5. Scenario 5: Input month as any negative integer and leap_year status. Although it's not explicitly handled in the function, this scenario could be tested to ensure method robustness.

6. Scenario 6: Input month as an integer greater than 12 and leap_year status. Similar to scenario 5, this case isn't handled in the code but could be tested to check functionality.

7. Scenario 7: Input month as 0 and leap_year status. Since month 0 doesn't exist, this is another extra functionality test scenario.

8. Scenario 8: Input invalid month (weekday, floats, etc.) and leap_year status. This scenario is to confirm correct function operation with unexpected input.

9. Scenario 9: Input valid month and invalid leap_year status (not Boolean). This case would test how the function handles unexpected leap_year inputs.

10. Scenario 10: Do not input any parameters. This will test how the function handles cases with missing parameters.
