"""
1. Scenario: Test with a month input that should return 31 days.
   - Given the month input is one of the following {1,3,5,7,8,10,12} 
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return 31.


2. Scenario: Test with a month input that should return 30 days.
   - Given the month input is one of the following {4,6,9,11}
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return 30.


3. Scenario: Test with "February" as the month input and it is a leap year.
   - Given the month input is 2 and leap_year is True
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return 29.


4. Scenario: Test with "February" as the month input and it is not a leap year.
   - Given the month input is 2 and leap_year is False
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return 28.


5. Scenario: Test with invalid month number.
   - Given the month input is not in the list {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return nothing or throw an error.


6. Scenario: Test with leap_year input that is neither True nor False. 
   - Given the leap_year input is not boolean
   - When the function is running
   - Then the function should return nothing or throw an error.
