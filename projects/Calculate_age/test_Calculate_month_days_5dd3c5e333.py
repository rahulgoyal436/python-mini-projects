"""
1. Scenario: Verify that the function returns 31 days for the months January, March, May, July, August, October, and December for both types of years (leap and non-leap).
   Input: Specific months = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
   Expected Output: 31

2. Scenario: Verify that the function returns 30 days for the months April, June, September, and November for both types of years (leap and non-leap).
   Input: Specific months = {4, 6, 9, 11}
   Expected Output: 30

3. Scenario: Verify that the function returns 28 days for the month of February during a non-leap year.
   Input: month = 2, leap_year = False
   Expected Output: 28
   
4. Scenario: Verify that the function returns 29 days for the month of February during a leap year.
   Input: month = 2, leap_year = True
   Expected Output: 29

5. Scenario: Ensure the function handles unusual or invalid month number inputs (13 or more, 0, and negative values) properly.
   Input: month = {13, 14, -1, 0}, leap_year = {True, False}
   Expected Output: This can vary based on how the function is improved to handle such cases: it can throw an error message, return None, or a consistant number of days regardless of input.

6. Scenario: Validate if the function handles unusual values of 'leap_year' input such as None, string types, or other non-boolean types.
   Input: month = valid month numbers, leap_year = {None, string types like 'abc', integer 1, float types like 1.5}
   Expected output: The output will vary depending on how the function is improved to accommodate such inputs; it may throw an error, return default number of days, or interpret any non-zero value as True and zero as False.

7. Scenario: Verify that the function handles 'None' or missing/omitted arguments correctly.
   Input: month = None, leap_year = None or month/leap_year = not provided
   Expected Output: This can vary based on how the function is improved to handle such cases: it can throw an error message, return None, or a consistant number of days regardless of input.
