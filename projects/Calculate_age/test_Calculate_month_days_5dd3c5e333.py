 '''
 1. Test scenario where the month given is one of the following: [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]. The function should return 31, which is the number of days in these months.

2. Test scenario where the month given is either 4, 6, 9, or 11. The function should return 30, which corresponds to the number of days in these months.

3. Test scenario where the month is 2 and the year is a leap year. The function should return 29 because February has 29 days in a leap year.

4. Test scenario where the month is February (2) and the year is not a leap year. The function should return 28 because February has 28 days in a non-leap year.

5. Test with a negative month number or a month number greater than 12. The function behavior for these scenarios isn't defined in the given snippet, so it could be important to understand and assess how it handles such invalid cases. 

6. Test with various non-integer values as month and leap year to assess how the function handles such values.

7. Test the scenario where the month or year is not provided, checking for how the function handles `None` or missing inputs.

8. Provide a non-boolean value for leap_year to see how function behaves.

9. Test the function with unusual data types for the parameters, such as strings or lists, and check how the function handles these.
