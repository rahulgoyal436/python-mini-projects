"""
1. Scenario: Test when month is January (1) and leap_year is True or False
   Expected: The function should return 31 as January always has 31 days.

2. Scenario: Test when month is February (2) and leap_year is True
   Expected: The function should return 29 as February in a leap year has 29 days.

3. Scenario: Test when month is February (2) and leap_year is False
   Expected: The function should return 28 as February in a non-leap year has 28 days.

4. Scenario: Test when month is one of the months with 31 days [March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), December (12)] and leap_year is True or False
   Expected: The function should return 31 as these months always have 31 days.

5. Scenario: Test when month is one of the months with 30 days [April (4), June (6), September (9), November (11)] and leap_year is True or False
   Expected: The function should return 30 as these months always have 30 days.

6. Scenario: Test when month is less than 1 or greater than 12
   Expected: The function should throw an error or return None as these are not valid months.

7. Scenario: Test when leap_year is not a boolean value
   Expected: The function should throw an error or return None as leap_year should be a boolean value.

8. Scenario: Test when month is a floating-point number
   Expected: The function should throw an error or return None as month should be an integer.

9. Scenario: Test when no arguments are provided
   Expected: The function should throw an error as both arguments are required.

10. Scenario: Test when more than two arguments are provided
    Expected: The function should throw an error as only two arguments are expected.
