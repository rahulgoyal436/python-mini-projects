"""
1. Test Scenario: Providing a month number and leap year status where month is in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year is either True or False.
    - Expected Output: The function should return 31 as these months always have 31 days.

2. Test Scenario: Giving a month number and leap year status where month is in [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year can be either True or False.
    - Expected Output: The function should return 30 as these months always have 30 days.

3. Test Scenario: Selecting the month as 2 and leap_year as False.
    - Expected Output: The function should return 28 as this is the number of days in February when it is not a leap year.

4. Test Scenario: Setting the month to 2 and leap_year as True.
    - Expected Output: The function should return 29 as this is the number of days in February during a leap year.

5. Test Scenario: Passing the month as zero and any value for leap_year.
   - Expected Output: As there is no handling for this case in the code, there is no expectation for a defined function output. This case is more to test the robustness of your function.

6. Test Scenario: Using negative integers for month and leap_year irrespective value. 
    - Expected Output: As there is no handling for this case, this will help to test the robustness of your function. There is no defined expectation for the output.

7. Test Scenario: Using numbers greater than 12 for the month, and any True/False value for leap_year. 
   - Expected Output: Similar to scenario 5 and 6, the function makes no provision for handling these kind of values, thus, testing its robustness. There is no definite expectation for the function's output.
