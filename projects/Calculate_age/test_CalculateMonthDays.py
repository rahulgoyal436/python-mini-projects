================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Best Practice - Avoid Hardcoding
Issue: Hardcoding can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities and make the code less maintainable and versatile
Solution: Consider storing these values in a data structure or config file that can be easily updated

Vulnerability: Best Practice - Input validation
Issue: Issue can arise when the input given to the month_days is not within an expected range (1-12)
Solution: Consider handling these cases with exceptions or checks

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate month_days for months with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_days_for_31_day_months
  Description: This test will check if the function correctly returns 31 for months that should have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is necessary.
  Act: We will call monthly_days for each of the months: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12. The second parameter does not affect the result, so it can be either True or False.
  Assert: We expect that 31 will be returned for each of these calls.
Validation:
  We are testing if the function correctly implements the business logic related to the number of days in months with 31 days.

Scenario 2: Validate month_days for months with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_days_for_30_day_months
  Description: This test will check if the function correctly returns 30 for months that should have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is necessary.
  Act: We will call monthly_days for each of the months: 4, 6, 9, 11. The second parameter does not affect the result, so it can be either True or False.
  Assert: We expect that 30 will be returned for each of these calls.
Validation:
  We are testing if the function correctly implements the business logic related to the number of days in months with 30 days.

Scenario 3: Validate month_days for February in leap years
Details:
  TestName: test_month_days_for_february_in_leap_years
  Description: This test will check if the function correctly returns 29 for February in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is necessary.
  Act: We will call monthly_days for February (month = 2) and leap_year = True.
  Assert: We expect that 29 will be returned.
Validation:
  We are testing if the function correctly implements the business logic related to the number of days in February during leap years.

Scenario 4: Validate month_days for February in non-leap years
Details:
  TestName: test_month_days_for_february_in_non_leap_years
  Description: This test will check if the function correctly returns 28 for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is necessary.
  Act: We will call monthly_days for February (month = 2) and leap_year = False.
  Assert: We expect that 28 will be returned.
Validation:
  We are testing if the function correctly implements the business logic related to the number of days in February during non-leap years. 

Scenario 5: Validate month_days for invalid month
Details:
  TestName: test_month_days_for_invalid_month
  Description: This test will check the behavior of function when invalid month value is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is necessary.
  Act: We will call monthly_days with month = 13 or month = 0, and any value for leap_year.
  Assert: As the function doesn't handle invalid month, it will return None. So, we expect that None will be returned.
Validation:
  Although this scenario is not explicitly handled by the function, it's important to note this, as handling it might be an improvement that could be considered. This scenario will validate this current behavior.
