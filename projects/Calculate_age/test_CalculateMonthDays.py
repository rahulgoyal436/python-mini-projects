================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Best Practice - Input Validation
Issue: The function 'month_days' does not perform any validation on its input. This could result in unexpected behavior or program crashes if the function is called with inappropriate arguments.
Solution: To address this, apply an input sanitization and validation process, thus ensuring 'month' is an integer in the range 1 to 12 and 'leap_year' is a boolean.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing Month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly returns the number of days for months with 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: The function will be invoked by passing a month with 31 days (either 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) and a boolean value for leap_year.
  Assert: The expected output is 31. This value will be checked using an assertion.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days.

Scenario 2: Testing Month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: This test is intended to validate if the function acts properly when a month is passed that should have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: The function will be invoked by passing a month with 30 days (either 4, 6, 9, 11) and a boolean value for leap_year.
  Assert: The expected output is 30. This value will be checked using an assertion.
Validation:
  This test is important to demonstrate the function can correctly identify months that have 30 days.

Scenario 3: Testing February in leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_feb_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns correctly the number of days of February during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: The function will be called with month as 2 and boolean value for leap_year as True.
  Assert: The expected output is 29, which will be checked using an assertion.
Validation:
  This scenario is key to confirm that the function takes into account leap years when calculating February's days.

Scenario 4: Testing February in non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_feb_non_leap_year
  Description: This test is intended to confirm the function properly returns the number of days in February during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup needed.
  Act: Invoke function with month as 2 and boolean value for leap_year as False.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 28, and validation will check this using an assertion.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensuring the function properly calculates the number of days in February during non-leap years.
