ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=calculate_month_days_5dd3c5e333

Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: This test will check if the function calculate.month_days returns 31 for months that should have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are necessary.
  Act: The function will be invoked with parameters like (1, False), (7, True), etc.
  Assert: Indicate the expected outcome will be 31.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test in accurately determining the length of months that should have 31 days.

Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: This test will check if the function calculate.month_days returns 30 for months that should have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are necessary.
  Act: The function will be invoked with parameters like (4, True), (6, False), etc.
  Assert: Indicate the expected outcome will be 30.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test in accurately determining the length of months that should have 30 days.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: This test will check if the function calculate.month_days returns 29 for February in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are necessary.
  Act: The function will be invoked with parameters (2, True).
  Assert: The expected outcome will be 29.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test in accurately determining the length of February in a leap year.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: This test will check if the function calculate.month_days returns 28 for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are necessary.
  Act: The function will be invoked with parameters (2, False).
  Assert: The expected outcome will be 28.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and accurately determining the length of February in a non-leap year.

Scenario 5: Test invalid month
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: This test will check if the function calculate.month_days does nothing or throws an error for an invalid month (e.g., 0, -1, 13).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements are necessary.
  Act: The function will be invoked with parameters like (-1, False), (13, True), etc.
  Assert: The expected outcome will be None or a raised exception.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test in validating the function's behavior with invalid input. 
  
Note: The Python source code provided does nothing for invalid months so the test can only check for this behavior.
