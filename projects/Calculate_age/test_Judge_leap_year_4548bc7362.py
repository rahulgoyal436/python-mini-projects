Test Scenario 1: Functionality test with a leap year
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a known leap year to ensure the program functions as expected.
- Data Input: A known leap year, e.g., 2020.
- Expected Output: The program should return "True".

Test Scenario 2: Functionality test with a non-leap year
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a known non-leap year to ensure the program functions as expected.
- Data Input: A known non-leap year, e.g., 2019.
- Expected Output: The program should return "False".

Test Scenario 3: Functionality test at the boundary
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a year at the boundary of the leap year, i.e., a year that is divisible by 100 but not 400.
- Data Input: 1900.
- Expected Output: The program should return "False".

Test Scenario 4: Functionality test with a rare leap year
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a year that is rarely a leap year, i.e., a year that is divisible by 400.
- Data Input: 2000.
- Expected Output: The program should return "True".

Test Scenario 5: Test with a future year 
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a future year to validate the function for years not yet reached.
- Data Input: A future year, e.g., 2030.
- Expected Output: The program should return based on the leap year calculation. For 2030, it should be "False". 

Test Scenario 6: Test with negative year
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a negative year value to see how the function handles this.
- Data Input: A negative year, e.g., -2000.
- Expected Output: The program should return results based on leap year calculations. Leap years also existed in the BC era, so for -2000, it should return "True". This, however, should be defined by the function's business logic and is not strictly a leap year rule.

Test Scenario 7: Test with a large value
- Description: Test the "judge_leap_year" function with a large year value to test the functionâ€™s upper limit.
- Data Input: A large year, e.g., 1000000.
- Expected Output: The program should return an output based on the leap year calculation, which in this case would be "False".
